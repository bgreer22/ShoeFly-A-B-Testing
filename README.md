# ShoeFly-A-B-Testing

This project examines the results of an A/B Test for an online shoe store ShoeFly.com. The company placed two different versions of an ad on several social media sites: Facbebook, Twitter, Google, as well as email. We will be looking at aggregate measures to compare the performance of each ad across the various platforms.

This project was originally conceived as a pandas/python project for Codecademy's Data Science Foundations Skill Path, but for this demonstration I decided to perform the analysis in Excel. After importing the data file from a csv .txt file, the analysis makes extensive use of the pivot table function in Excel to aggregate the data in different ways.

The repository for this project includes the data as a csv file, the imported data as an Excel spreadsheet, the pivot tables used for the project along with textual exposition describing the steps of the analysis, as well as accompanying data visualizations.
